ECharts is a powerful data-visualization library that can be used to create a variety of charts and graphs. In my React project, I have utilized ECharts to create two charts for the Wine data. These charts are a scatter chart and a bar chart, both of which allow users to easily see and understand the data.
Both charts are highly customizable and user-friendly, allowing users to interact with the data and gain valuable insights. However, it is important to note that this project is solely for educational purposes and the Wine data should not be used for commercial purposes without proper authorization.
